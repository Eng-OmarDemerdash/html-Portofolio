    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Omar Mahmoud - I am currently studying at Cairo University (2nd Year) @ Communication and Computer Engineering (CCE)</p>

    <p>From a very young age, I have been fond of smartphones and creating files on Microsoft Word which I was obssessed with. 
    This love for technology inside me kept growing everyday, discovering new things and different persecpectives everyday.</p>

    <p>My target is to improve myself in my field of study and work by either taking online courses 
    or joining an intership. Looking up to top people in this field and learning from them.
